We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our application or services or transacting business with us. By using our website, application or other online services (our &ldquo;Service&rdquo;), you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Information we collect about you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">In General.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;We may collect Personal Information, including Sensitive Data, and other information. &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo; means individually identifiable information that would allow us to determine the actual identity of, and contact, a specific living person. Sensitive Data includes information, comments or content (e.g. photographs, video, profile, lifestyle) that you optionally provide that may reveal your ethnic origin, nationality, religion and/or sexual orientation. By providing Sensitive Data to us, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of Sensitive Data as permitted by applicable privacy laws. We may also collect your geolocation information with your consent. We may collect this information through a website, mobile application, or other online services. By using the Service, you are authorizing us to gather, parse and retain data related to the provision of the Service. When you provide personal information through our Service, the information may be sent to servers located in the United States and countries around the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c6">Information you provide.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;In order to register as a user with Winkd, you will be asked to sign in using your Facebook login. If you do so, you authorize us to access certain Facebook account information, such as your public Facebook profile (consistent with your privacy settings in Facebook), your email address, interests, likes, gender, birthday, education history, relationship interests, current city, photos, personal description, friend list, and information about and photos of your Facebook friends who might be common Facebook friends with other Winkd users. You will also be asked to allow Winkd to collect your location information from your device when you download or use the Service. In addition, we may collect and store any personal information you provide while using our Service or in some other manner. This may include identifying information, such as your name, address, email address and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information. You may also provide us photos, a personal description and information about your gender and preferences for recommendations, such as search distance, age range and gender. If you chat with other Winkd users, you provide us the content of your chats, and if you contact us with a customer service or other inquiry, you provide us with the content of that communication.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c6">Information collected automatically.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;We automatically collect information from your browser or device when you visit our Service. This information could include your IP address, device ID and type, your browser type and language, the operating system used by your device, access times, your mobile device&rsquo;s geographic location while our application is actively running, and the referring website address.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c6">Cookies and use of cookie and similar data.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;When you visit our Service, we may assign your device one or more cookies or other technologies that facilitate personalization to facilitate access to our Service and to personalize your experience. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your activity on our Service, such as the pages you visit, the time and date of your visits and the links you click. If we advertise, we (or third parties) may use certain data collected on our Service to show you Winkd advertisements on other sites or applications.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c6">Pixel tags.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;We embed pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) on web pages, ads, and emails. These tiny, invisible graphics are used to access cookies and track user activities (such as how many times a page is viewed). We use pixel tags to measure the popularity of our features and services. Ad companies also use pixel tags to measure the number of ads displayed and their performance (such as how many people clicked on an ad).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c6">Mobile device IDs.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;If you&#39;re using our app, we use mobile device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), or Advertising IDs (for iOS 6 and later), instead of cookies, to recognize you. We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our app. Unlike cookies, device IDs cannot be deleted, but Advertising IDs can be reset in &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; on your iPhone. Ad companies also use device IDs or Advertising IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and display ads that are more relevant to you. Analytics companies use device IDs to track information about app usage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">How we use the information we collect</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">In General.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;We may use information that we collect about you to:</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0">deliver and improve our products and services, and manage our business;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">manage your account and provide you with customer support;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our or others&rsquo; products, services, or content;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">communicate with you by email, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us or other third parties;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">develop, display, and track content and advertising tailored to your interests on our Service and other sites, including providing our advertisements to you when you visit other sites;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">website or mobile application analytics;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with contests and sweepstakes;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">enforce or exercise any rights in our Terms of Use; and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">perform functions or services as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Job applicants.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;If your Personal Information is submitted when applying for a position with our company, the information will be used solely in connection with considering and acting upon your application.

DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information we collect and that is why we provide the opt-out links above. However, we do not recognize or respond to any DNT signals, as the Internet industry works toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">How you can access and correct your information</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you have a Winkd account, you have the ability to review and update your personal information within the Service by opening your account and going to settings.
